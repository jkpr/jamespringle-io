:wave: Hello! My name is James. I am a husband and a father in my wee family.
For work, I am an Engineering Team Lead for a public health project called
[Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA)](https://www.pmadata.org) within Johns Hopkins University.
I have worked remotely since 2018.

I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, learning about personal finance, and speaking Russian as a foreign language.
