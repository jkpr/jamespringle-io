# Introduction

Welcome, reader. This is the start of a new blog. I intend primarily to write about programming, computers, and
technology. This will be a record of what I am learning, what tricks have come in handy, and general expository prose.
Above all, this should be about my journey and how I can lend a helping hand to someone else who has not gotten as far
as I have. You, a curious learner, are my target audience as well as my future, forgetful self.

# How I got into programming

When I was in high school, I had a TI-89 calculator. It was a glorious device with which I read e-books and played
games. I also wrote little programs to help in my math classes and published them on
[ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/). I would spend hours reading through the calculator programming manual to find
just the right commands to make buttons, handle input, and trigger calculations. I would get a tremendous amount of
satisfaction in creating something that (1) worked correctly, (2) was useful to others, and (3) helped me with my
homework. And it was all there in my handheld device, my calculator.

My next foray into programming was when I joined a mathematics research group at university. They were writing Python
code with [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/), and I was using that code to explore interesting mathematical properties.
Unfortunately for my professor, I was less interested in the math than I was in the actual coding.

From there, the rest is history. I have kept computers and getting them to do useful things a central part of my
learning and work.

# Currently interesting technologies

Technologies I'm interested in right now:

- Python
- Redis
- Docker
- Pandas
- Data science
- Android
- Flask and Django
- Vim
- Git

I expect to write about each of these topics and many more!

From time to time I will probably write posts on other things I am interested in, such as mathematics or photography.
Only time will tell.
