At the start of each new year, take a step back and review the tools you use, read a little in their documentation, and see if you can do things better.

After the long break for Christmas and with the start of a new year, coming back to work in January can feel a little like beginning afresh. When I start up again in January, I like to review the tools I use and try to see if I can use them better. Throughout the year, we quickly form habits for how we like to use software and write code. This speeds up our work as things flow from muscle memory. However, our muscle memory may not be the most efficient way!

Currently, I am using Visual Studio Code, Git, and Python a lot. What can I do to sharpen these tools? 

For Visual Studio Code, I can click through each tab in the [settings page][vs-settings] and try to understand what each section is doing. I can read documentation on Microsoft's [website][vs-docs]. I can try out a few new [shortcuts][vs-shortcut]. Even though I use this software nearly every day, I am certain I am not using it optimally.

[vs-docs]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs
[vs-shortcut]: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf

For Git, I can review [changes][git-changes] in recent versions. I can watch a few [recordings][git-recording] of presentations on features. I can read the full manual page of some [commands][git-command] that I use frequently, or ones that I have seen on StackOverflow.

[git-recording]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6jD966jzlk
[git-command]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase

For Python, I can skim through a [book][python-book]. I can read [module documentation][python-module] from the standard library. I can try out a popular [package][python-package] that I have not used yet.

[python-book]: https://pythonbooks.org/for-programming-beginners/
[python-module]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
[python-package]: https://pypi.org/project/plotly/

As programmers, part of our job is to continually hone our craft and sharpen our skills. We must be intentional about this and set goals.

My goals for the upcoming little while are to learn more about this blogging platform (Hugo) and to learn more about web development in general. What goals will you set to get better?
