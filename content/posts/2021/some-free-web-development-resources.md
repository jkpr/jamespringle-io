There are high-quality free online courses available to learn web development.

The first one I will start with is [Flexbox Zombies][zombies]. This is marketed as a game that will help you learn the various features of [CSS Flexbox][flexbox]. The game has a value of $179, but [Dave Geddes][geddes] is giving it away free.

[zombies]: https://flexboxzombies.com
[flexbox]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox
[geddes]: https://mastery.games

The idea of the game is that you are learning to use the Flexbox Crossbow and its different capabilities in order to kill zombies. The various ways to position flex items are how you aim at the zombies in order to shoot them.

The game is very good because it gives you rep after rep after rep. In short order, it becomes automatic to start typing (for example):

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

This game accomplished its goal of teaching me CSS Flexbox. I think it is a great game with a high level of polish! I definitely recommend it.

Geddes has other games available, too. There is [Grid Critters][critters] (paid) for learning [CSS Grid][grid]. Geddes was sponsored by Google to create [Service Workies][workies] for learning [Service Workers][workers].

[critters]: https://gridcritters.com/
[grid]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid
[workies]: https://serviceworkies.com/
[workers]: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers

You can learn more about Geddes's indie developer history and how he developed his games to learn programming from a [podcast interview he gave][geddes-podcast] for Courtland Allen at Indie Hackers.

The next free resource is Web Bos's [Javascript30 challenge][js30]. This is a free course he is offering to teach 30 different concepts in vanilla Javascript, including features from ES6 and beyond. There are 30 videos for 30 different "mini-projects".

I recommend this online course, too! It is great to work with various features of Javascript and to read through the docs at MDN. Wes Bos has a very good tutorial style that is easy to follow.

Wes Bos is very prolific in producing content on web development. He has [other courses][wesbos-courses], some free and some paid. Check him out at his website [wesbos.com][wesbos].

{{< figure src="/static/img/2021/mdn-home.png" alt="Mozilla Developer Network" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="MDN Web Docs, at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" captionPosition="center" >}}

The last resource I will recommend is [MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) Web Docs][mdn]. MDN has documentation for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. How many times when I tried web development in the past and needed to search something did I end up at [W3Schools][w3schools]? Because W3Schools (still!) ranks higher than MDN on search, I have to be intentional to add "mdn" to my search query.

MDN is a true "documentation" site in that it documents all aspects of a feature. It also has teaching articles. W3Schools seems incomplete by comparison. If you have any question about a topic in web development or want to look up an API for Javascript, then try MDN first!
