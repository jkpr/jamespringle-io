Fight Zoom fatigue by going outside and walking during meetings.

One inevitable consequence of the pandemic is working from home and having virtual meetings. Some days seem to be nothing but sitting at a desk and being at attention on Zoom. As the day wears on, posture slips, focus wanes, and exhaustion sets in.

My solution to this problem is something I call "**Walk and Work**." In other words, go on a walk, call into the meeting, listen on mute, and participate as usual.

It is unnecessary to be glued to a desktop computer during meetings. This is for several reasons:

1. Virtual meeting software, such as Zoom, can be downloaded to a smartphone. So at the very least, the meeting can be carried around. But more importantly, there is often a "call-in" phone number. This saves data and simplifies the meeting experience when walking outside.
2. Presenters usually read slides when screens are being shared, so listening is usually sufficient to understand the message.
3. Agendas, objectives, and materials are often shared ahead of time. These can be pulled up on a smartphone (or printed ahead of time!) for reference while walking, if needed. 

A typical meeting lasts an hour, and in that time it is entirely reasonable to walk three miles or more.

# Foster a culture of Walk and Work

Just like we changed our work culture to normalize so many virtual meetings, we can also change work culture to support Walk and Work. Here are some suggestions:

- **Set up virtual meetings that include call-in details.** Calling in is the preferred way to Walk and Work because it does not require to pay for data for a video call.
- **Share agendas and presentations ahead of time.** This lets a walker plan the Walk and Work out. Some ways to prepare are to copy down the call-in information, download presentation slides to a smartphone, and prepare thoughts and updates for sharing.
- **Do not be worried if walkers speak and sound out of breath.** Walking is exercise, and it is natural to get a little out of breath.

# My experience

So far my record is to Walk and Work during back-to-back meetings, for a total of two hours and 6.5 miles.

Having children at home (when that happens) is not a barrier, surprisingly, since I simply put them in a stroller and take them along with me. They usually can tolerate an hour walking around. If it seems like they are losing patience, we can swing by a playground. It is definitely more difficult with them, though.

Finally, one unexpected benefit is that I actually am more engaged in the meeting when I Walk and Work, and I remember more from meetings. If I'm sitting at a computer during a meeting, it is very easy to slip into multitask mode, such as responding to chat notifications. When I Walk and Work, I pay attention to what everyone is saying because I do not have other distractions.

Walk and Work has become a highlight of my work schedule. I love getting fresh air, a little exercise, and exploring my neighborhood and nearby nature. See if this could be something that might improve your work week!
